Usage: sRPCgen [OPTION] PROTO_BIN_FILE
Parse the PROTO_BIN_FILE and generate C# code for the rpc services based on 
the options given:
  --file=PROTO_BIN_FILE     Specify the descriptor file for the protobuf
                            implementation of the RPC interface. This file
                            has to contains all required imports.
                            This file can generated with protoc and the
                            --descriptor_set_out option.
                            This option is automatilcy set if a file name
                            is given.
  --output-dir=OUT_DIR      The path where the generated C# source files has
                            to be placed. If not set the current working
                            directory is used.
  --namespace-base=NS_BASE  The base name for the output namespace. This is
                            only used to determine the output file name and
                            will shorten the path. If not set the whole
                            namespace name of the service will recreated
                            as directory structure.
